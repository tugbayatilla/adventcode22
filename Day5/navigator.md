# Goals (WIP 3)

- parse data file
  - read until emtpy line, first part will be cargo, second part will be movements
  - parse movements 
- AfterRearrangementCratesFromTopOfEachStacks
  - if there is no crate in stack, it will fail, write test and implement
  - 


# Smells (WIP 3)
 
- AdventDay5.AddCrateToStack
  - nested if, too complex, hard to read
- cargo count is more than expected.

# Improvements (WIP 3)

- stack can be an object class
