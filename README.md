## The Journey - There and back again

> to remember what happened during the journey. 

### Day1

- it was easy, looked like kind of warm up, 
- good approach i would say.

### Day2

- I was challenging than yesterday.
- I made a mistake because i mis-interpreted the requirements yet at the end with my test, i figured out what it was in draw calculation.
- I merged draw and win situation tests because of sonarlint suggestions, i think i was a mistake to do that. 
  - because it was clear when they were seperated, easy to read, identify. 
- i did some refactoring after part2. 
  - it was quite good to focus on the code and make it better. yet it would be nice to do that during the process.

### Day3

- After first part implementation, it was quite easy to implement part2.

### Day4

- first direction led me to bigger steps
- i decided to change the direction to be able to make smaller steps.
- i so focused to new direction so i forgot to check initial direction.
- so at the end, i have unused public methods.
- what time is it! refactor time :) but later of course, and maybe :)

### Day5

- No comment
